----Attack on Planet 21 Readme----
   Created by Vanessa Kindell

Thank you for trying this game.
This is a slightly updated version of the first game I ever programed.
This game was programed using Blitz3D by Blitz Resarch ltd.
The graphics were drawn by me at a young age using MSPaint.

--Gameplay--
You are a ship being attacked by an onslaught of ailen ships hell-bent
on taking over Planet 21. You must survive exponentially more difficult waves
of these ships in a last ditch attept to save the planet from it inevitable
distruction.

Occasionally, destroying a ailen ship will cause it to drop a health powerup worth +1.

Ailen ships with more than 1 health will show the number of their health.

Each wave will have one more ailen ship than the last and each go faster.
Destroying as many as possible is nessisary to prolong
your life and increase your score.

--Control--
There are two ways to control your ship:
 Mouse control: (recomended)
  Mouse Left/Right:       Fly Left/Right
  Mouse button 1 (left):  Fire lazers
  Mouse button 2 (right): Detonate all lazers (to avoid score loss)
 Keyboard control: (not recomended)
  Left/Right arrow keys:  Fly Left/Right (slowly)
  Spacebar:               Fire lazers
  There is no way to detonate lazers with the keyboard
