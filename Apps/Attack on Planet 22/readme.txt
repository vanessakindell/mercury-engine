--Gameplay--
You are a ship being attacked by an onslaught of flying saucers hell-bent
on taking over Planet 22. You must survive exponentially more difficult waves
of these ships in a last ditch attept to save the planet from it inevitable
distruction.

Occasionally, destroying a flying saucer will cause it to drop a powerup.
They are as follows:
        Red: Lazer powerup - gives you more firepower
        Blue: Health powerup - gives you +1 health

Flying saucers with more than 1 health will show the number of their health.

Each wave will have one more flying saucer than the last and each will have
one more health. Destroying as many as possible is nessisary to prolong
your life and increase your score.

--Control--
There are two ways to control your ship:
 Mouse control: (recomended)
  Mouse Left/Right:       Fly Left/Right
  Mouse button 1 (left):  Fire lazers
  Mouse button 2 (right): Detonate all lazers (to avoid score loss)
 Keyboard control: (not recomended)
  Left/Right arrow keys:  Fly Left/Right (slowly)
  Spacebar:               Fire lazers
  There is no way to detonate lazers with the keyboard
