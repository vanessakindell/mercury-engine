# mercury-engine
Engine built in Blitz3D to run the Attack on Planet series of simple space shooters. Developed as a programming excersise in the form of a coding sprint when I was in high school.

Built using Blitz3D v1.94. Compatibility with other versions is untested and not supported.
It will not work with BlitzBasic, BlitzPlus, BlitzMax, or Max3D.

To compile, open mercury-engine/Apps/[APP NAME]/[APP NAME].bb in the Blitz3D IDE and use the IDE's controls to compile the code.

There's almost certainly there's old high school jokes, memes, nonsense, and warnings about external release in the code. I have not bothered to go back and fix any of it as I have better things to do with my time. They can be safely ignored or if someone cares enough to go through and remove then by all means knock yourself out.
