# mercury-engine
Engine built in Blitz3D to run the Attack on Planet series of simple space shooters. Developed as a programming excersise in the form of a coding sprint when I was in high school.

Built using Blitz3D v1.94. Compatibility with other versions is untested and not supported.
It will not work with BlitzBasic, BlitzPlus, BlitzMax, or Max3D.

To compile, open mercury-engine/Apps/[APP NAME]/[APP NAME].bb in the Blitz3D IDE and use the IDE's controls to compile the code.
